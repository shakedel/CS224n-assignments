# CS224n AssignmentsHere you will find my code solutions to Stanford's CS224n assignments (winter 2018). The code was converted to conform with python 3.x (originally 2.x). All of the questions are answered and pass the tests and benchmarks.The handout PDFs (plus solutions) and the original *.zip archives (containing the datasets missing from this repo) can be found [here]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NkAJ7qDLQqGfjC2Ttauv_gjMUh17bfc5?usp=sharing)
